# Changes

* Change column joining character from "." to "â†’" otherwise dots in column heading names (e.g. "Broad groupings (e.g. White, Black, Asian, mixed, other)") will break things. It is less likely that people will use an arrow character in their headings.

To do:

* Only include columns that are explicitly defined in the config so that we can use the same data file for multiple cut-down tables
* Construct columns from other columns following a template
* Set column % width?
