summary: |
  Data gaps can make it difficult to understand key outcomes for young people from ethnic minority backgrounds.
  
  Young people from minority ethnic backgrounds have long experienced higher unemployment and lower wages than their white peers. The impact of the Coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated these inequalities, with research showing an unequal impact on employment across ethnic groups. In addition, previous work has identified substantial gaps in the collection and analysis of data relating to young people from minority ethnic backgrounds. There are particular concerns around systematic erasure in data collection, lack of observations and small sample sizes, and a lack of culturally relevant data.
  
  The data analysis and quantitative review have identified a range of gaps in data and analysis of the employment outcomes of young people from minority ethnic backgrounds, broadly relating to the three themes of systematic erasure in data collection, lack of observations and sampling, and a lack of culturally relevant data. This includes gaps in terms of availability of ethnic breakdowns; demographic data; employment details and features of surveys or datasets.

    summary: |      
      Not all national datasets include breakdowns by ethnic group. In particular, current (and planned future) releases of Universal Credit statistics do not include ethnic breakdowns, unlike statistics on Jobseekers Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance. This gap impedes understanding of the uptake of specific benefits by different ethnic groups.

      Progression and discrimination in employment are substantial gaps in this area. Although they were not included in our data analysis, the quantitative review shows that they are rarely covered in analysis of employment outcomes for minority ethnic young people. This gap prevents a full understanding of the experience of employment by minority ethnic groups.

      The latest wave of the Millennium Cohort Study did not ask young people (aged 17) their ethnicity, requiring the use of parental ethnicity in analysis. This gap masks any changes in ethnic identification between young people and their parents, and may lead to errors where parents are from separate ethnic backgrounds. However, it should be noted that the next wave of the study will ask young people their ethnicity.

      Although the quantitative review identified a number of studies that included culturally relevant data, many national surveys (e.g. Labour Force family of surveys) do not include relevant cultural questions.

  - title: Lack of Culturally Relevant Data
    summary: |
      <span class="note">Review</span>
      There is a particular gap in relation to Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller groups. These groups are frequently excluded from surveys and national data. Where they are included, sample sizes are too small in order to conduct meaningful analysis. Individuals from these backgrounds may not identify their ethnicity in surveys or may use a broader ethnic group (e.g. Irish). In addition, data on employment outcomes does not contain the nuance necessary to account for specific cultural experiences in this area. The quantitative review also showed that these groups are generally not included in analysis in this area.

      There is another gap in relation to regional and subregional data. Although these variables exist in national surveys and datasets, our analysis shows that sample sizes are generally too small for meaningful regional analysis of the employment outcomes of young people from minority ethnic groups. Regional analysis was also generally lacking in the evidence assessed in the quantitative review. In addition, there is a lack of published local datasets and data on culturally relevant regional issues.
