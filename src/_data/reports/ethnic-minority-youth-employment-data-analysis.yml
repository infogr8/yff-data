  - |
    Data gaps can make it difficult to understand key outcomes for young people from ethnic minority backgrounds.
  
    Young people from minority ethnic backgrounds have long experienced higher unemployment and lower wages than their white peers. The impact of the Coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated these inequalities, with research showing an unequal impact on employment across ethnic groups. In addition, previous work has identified substantial gaps in the collection and analysis of data relating to young people from minority ethnic backgrounds. There are particular concerns around systematic erasure in data collection, lack of observations and small sample sizes, and a lack of culturally relevant data.

    The data analysis and quantitative review have identified a range of gaps in data and analysis of the employment outcomes of young people from minority ethnic backgrounds, broadly relating to the three themes of systematic erasure in data collection, lack of observations and sampling, and a lack of culturally relevant data. This includes gaps in terms of availability of ethnic breakdowns; demographic data; employment details and features of surveys or datasets.

  - title: Systemic Erasure in Data Collection
    summary: |      
      Capturing data about the experience of different ethnic groups, alongside other key demographic information such as geographic region, socioeconomic status, and religion is crucial to allowing intersectional analysis and thereby fully understanding the experiences of different ethnic groups.

      Few national datasets or other evidence include breakdowns by ethnic groups at a sufficiently granular level to understand the impact of policy changes or interventions, with some such as the Universal Credit statistics not including ethnic breakdowns. This lack of data capture impedes understanding of the uptake of specific benefits by different ethnic groups, and is in contrast to statistics on Jobseekers Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance. 

      Where datasets do include ethnicity, most focus on broad ethnic groupings based on the standard five ethnic groups included in ONS research (white, black, Asian, mixed, and other). Where more detailed ethnic groups are used, this is often limited to the 16-18 detailed ethnic groups used in ONS research, meaning that relevant subgroups, such Somali as a subcategory of black African, are not included. This results in a lack of understanding of the experience of these subgroups. 

      There are other ways in which ethnic identity is erased. For instance, Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller groups are frequently excluded from surveys and national data leading to a gap in data available for analysis, and the latest wave of the Millennium Cohort Study did not ask young people (aged 17) their ethnicity, instead using parental ethnicity in analysis. This gap masks any changes in ethnic identification between young people and their parents, and may lead to errors where parents are from separate ethnic backgrounds. However, the next wave of the study will ask young people their ethnicity.

            caption: |
              There is generally poor coverage of demographic breakdowns to enable significant analysis in the employment outcomes of young people from minority ethnic backgrounds.

              Two-way intersectional analysis refers to evidence that includes the analysis of an employment outcome by ethnic group by another variable, while three-way intersectional analysis refers to evidence that includes analysis of an employment variable by ethnic group by two other variables.

  - title: Lack of Culturally Relevant Data
    summary: |
      While the timeliness of data is generally good, only 4 pieces of evidence fully met this criteria by including a time period that covered both pre- and post-pandemic data.   

      Many communities experience challenges or barriers not shared by the majority population, or by other minority ethnic communities. There are also differences in practices, experiences and systems of support across different cultures and communities, such as different approaches to debt or differences in access to personal protective equipment, that may be missed or misunderstood without the collection of relevant data. 

      The review shows that culturally relevant data is generally lacking in evidence on employment outcomes for young people from minority ethnic groups, with many data collection instruments not covering questions or considerations that are culturally relevant for specific ethnic groups. 

      This creates challenges as the data on employment outcomes does not contain the nuance necessary to account for specific cultural experiences, and leads to a lack of understanding about the specific challenges faced.  

      In addition to this, there is a lack of published local datasets and data on culturally relevant regional issues.

            Evidence looked in at the quantitative review was assessed against eight different types of employment grouping criteria: 

            * <b>Employment status:</b> Whether an individual is employed, unemployed, in education, or in training
            * <b>Sector:</b> Industry sector of employment. 
            * <b>Occupation:</b> Occupational role of employment 
            * <b>Contract type:</b> Details of contract type, such as security of contract or guaranteed hours. 
            * <b>Apprenticeships:</b> Details on apprenticeship participation, level and/or sector.  
            * <b>Pay:</b> Information about salaries, such as yearly averages or hourly pay. 
            * <b>Progression:</b> This refers to information about progression in labour market outcomes of individuals, such as salary increases or changes in employment status. 
            * <b>Discrimination in employment:</b> Self-identified experiences of ethnic discrimination in the workplace. 

            Employment characteristics are generally poorly represented in evidence on employment outcomes for young people from minority
            ethnic groups, with employment status the only employment characteristic that was well represented across the evidence, especially
            in Government statistics websites and some academic studies. 

            Other employment characteristics fared much worse. Details of employment such as sector, occupation and contract types are poorly
            covered in the analysis of employment outcomes for minority ethnic young people. The review shows that information on discrimination
            in employment is a substantial gap, with only one piece of evidence reviewed included any mention of discrimination in employment in
            their analysis. 

            This lack of data on key employment details in many reports combined with low sample sizes in those reports where this is considered
            makes it impossible to conduct meaningful analysis of employment details by granular ethnic group. 

            This prevents a full understanding of the experience of employment by minority ethnic groups.

            The quantitative review showed that measures of job quality, such as contract type, hours worked and pay, are generally poorly covered in the evidence in this area. Our data analysis was able to identify some useful findings in relation to job quality. However, sample sizes limited the level of granular and intersectional analysis that could be conducted. 

            Progression and discrimination in employment are substantial gaps in this area. Although they were not included in our data analysis, the quantitative review shows that they are rarely covered in analysis of employment outcomes for minority ethnic young people. This gap prevents a full understanding of the experience of employment by minority ethnic groups.
