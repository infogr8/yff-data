summary:
  - |
    Data gaps can make it difficult to understand key outcomes for young people
    from ethnic minority backgrounds.
  
    Young people from minority ethnic backgrounds have long experienced higher
    unemployment and lower wages than their white peers. The impact of the
    Coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated these inequalities, with research
    showing an unequal impact on employment across ethnic groups. In addition,
    previous work has identified substantial gaps in the collection and analysis
    of data relating to young people from minority ethnic backgrounds. There are
    particular concerns around systematic erasure in data collection, lack of
    observations and small sample sizes, and a lack of culturally relevant data.

  - |
    The data analysis and quantitative review have identified a range of gaps in
    data and analysis of the employment outcomes of young people from minority
    ethnic backgrounds, broadly relating to the three themes of systematic
    erasure in data collection, lack of observations and sampling, and a lack of
    culturally relevant data. This includes gaps in terms of availability of
    ethnic breakdowns; demographic data; employment details and features of
    surveys or datasets.

  - title: Systemic erasure in data collection
    summary: |      
      Capturing data about the experience of different ethnic groups, alongside
      other key demographic information such as geographic region, socioeconomic
      status, and religion is crucial to allowing intersectional analysis and
      thereby fully understanding the experiences of different ethnic groups.

      Few national datasets or other evidence include breakdowns by ethnic
      groups at a sufficiently granular level to understand the impact of policy
      changes or interventions, with some such as the Universal Credit
      statistics not including ethnic breakdowns. This lack of data capture
      impedes understanding of the uptake of specific benefits by different
      ethnic groups, and is in contrast to statistics on Jobseekers Allowance or
      Employment and Support Allowance. 

      Where datasets do include ethnicity, most focus on broad ethnic groupings
      based on the standard five ethnic groups included in ONS research (white,
      black, Asian, mixed, and other). Where more detailed ethnic groups are
      used, this is often limited to the 16-18 detailed ethnic groups used in
      ONS research, meaning that relevant subgroups, such Somali as a
      subcategory of black African, are not included. This results in a lack of
      understanding of the experience of these subgroups. 

      There are other ways in which ethnic identity is erased. For instance,
      Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller groups are frequently excluded from
      surveys and national data leading to a gap in data available for analysis,
      and the latest wave of the Millennium Cohort Study did not ask young
      people (aged 17) their ethnicity, instead using parental ethnicity in
      analysis. This gap masks any changes in ethnic identification between
      young people and their parents, and may lead to errors where parents are
      from separate ethnic backgrounds. However, the next wave of the study will
      ask young people their ethnicity.

          - title: Coverage of intersectional analysis in quantitative evidence
            caption: |
              There is generally poor coverage of demographic breakdowns to
              enable significant analysis in the employment outcomes of young
              people from minority ethnic backgrounds.

              Two-way intersectional analysis refers to evidence that includes
              the analysis of an employment outcome by ethnic group by another
              variable, while three-way intersectional analysis refers to
              evidence that includes analysis of an employment variable by
              ethnic group by two other variables.

  - title: Lack of culturally relevant data
    summary: |
      While the timeliness of data is generally good, only 4 pieces of evidence
      fully met this criteria by including a time period that covered both pre-
      and post-pandemic data.   

      Many communities experience challenges or barriers not shared by the
      majority population, or by other minority ethnic communities. There are
      also differences in practices, experiences and systems of support across
      different cultures and communities, such as different approaches to debt
      or differences in access to personal protective equipment, that may be
      missed or misunderstood without the collection of relevant data. 

      The review shows that culturally relevant data is generally lacking in
      evidence on employment outcomes for young people from minority ethnic
      groups, with many data collection instruments not covering questions or
      considerations that are culturally relevant for specific ethnic groups. 

      This creates challenges as the data on employment outcomes does not
      contain the nuance necessary to account for specific cultural experiences,
      and leads to a lack of understanding about the specific challenges faced.  

      In addition to this, there is a lack of published local datasets and data
      on culturally relevant regional issues.

            Evidence looked in at the quantitative review was assessed against
            eight different types of employment grouping criteria: 

            * <b>Employment status:</b> Whether an individual is employed, unemployed, in education, or in training
            * <b>Sector:</b> Industry sector of employment. 
            * <b>Occupation:</b> Occupational role of employment 
            * <b>Contract type:</b> Details of contract type, such as security of contract or guaranteed hours. 
            * <b>Apprenticeships:</b> Details on apprenticeship participation, level and/or sector.  
            * <b>Pay:</b> Information about salaries, such as yearly averages or hourly pay. 
            * <b>Progression:</b> This refers to information about progression in labour market outcomes of individuals, such as salary increases or changes in employment status. 
            * <b>Discrimination in employment:</b> Self-identified experiences of ethnic discrimination in the workplace. 

            Employment characteristics are generally poorly represented in
            evidence on employment outcomes for young people from minority
            ethnic groups, with employment status the only employment
            characteristic that was well represented across the evidence,
            especially in Government statistics websites and some academic
            studies. 

            Other employment characteristics fared much worse. Details of
            employment such as sector, occupation and contract types are poorly
            covered in the analysis of employment outcomes for minority ethnic
            young people. The review shows that information on discrimination in
            employment is a substantial gap, with only one piece of evidence
            reviewed included any mention of discrimination in employment in
            their analysis. 

            This lack of data on key employment details in many reports combined
            with low sample sizes in those reports where this is considered
            makes it impossible to conduct meaningful analysis of employment
            details by granular ethnic group. 

            This prevents a full understanding of the experience of employment
            by minority ethnic groups.

            The quantitative review showed that measures of job quality, such as
            contract type, hours worked and pay, are generally poorly covered in
            the evidence in this area. Our data analysis was able to identify
            some useful findings in relation to job quality. However, sample
            sizes limited the level of granular and intersectional analysis that
            could be conducted. 

            Progression and discrimination in employment are substantial gaps in
            this area. Although they were not included in our data analysis, the
            quantitative review shows that they are rarely covered in analysis
            of employment outcomes for minority ethnic young people. This gap
            prevents a full understanding of the experience of employment by
            minority ethnic groups.
