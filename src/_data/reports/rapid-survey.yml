          caption: |
            Young Black people place larger emphasis on making their family and friends proud when thinking about future jobs (22%, compared to 17% of the overall sample), and much more likely than Asian young people to prioritise impressing their friends and family (11% vs. 5%) or being able to work for themselves (21% vs. 12%). 
            
            Across all ethnic minority groups, males found impressing their family and friends significantly more important (13%) than their female counterparts (4%). This gender gap was in particular driven by young Black males (18%, vs 7% of Black females), but could also be seen among Asian young people (21% of young Asian males vs. 16% young Asian females). Young Asian people are much less likely than those from White minority or Black backgrounds to be influenced by their friends (9% vs. 18% and 17% respectively).

        - title: Personal Influences
          caption: Young people from ethnic minorities are most likely to be influenced by their own interests and passions when thinking about their future career (with 26% saying this is the most important factor, and 54% ranking this in the top 3). Mental health (33%), family (32%), the state of the job market/ economy (32%) are also influential factors.
