            Young Black people place larger emphasis on making their family and friends proud when thinking about future jobs (22%, compared to 17% of the overall sample), and much more likely than Asian young people to prioritise impressing their friends and family (11% vs. 5%) or being able to work for themselves (21% vs. 12%). 
            
            Across all ethnic minority groups, males found impressing their family and friends significantly more important (13%) than their female counterparts (4%). This gender gap was in particular driven by young Black males (18%, vs 7% of Black females), but could also be seen among Asian young people (21% of young Asian males vs. 16% young Asian females). Young Asian people are much less likely than those from White minority or Black backgrounds to be influenced by their friends (9% vs. 18% and 17% respectively).

            Gender, along with ethnicity, is a key differentiator for being optimistic about one’s prospects in the labour market. Black females show the highest levels of confidence of any group, male or female (82%, and only 5% saying they are not confident). 
            In contrast, one in five (22%) black males are not confident they will achieve their goals. Asian males are significantly more confident than their female counterparts (76% vs 66%), as are White minority males (75% vs. 71%).
