<h2>About the data on this page </h2>
<p>
These visualisations are driven by consumer price inflation (CPI) data from the 
Office for National Statistics 
<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceinflation"> available here.</a> 
</p>

<p>
The page is automatically updated when the latest CPI data is published. The current data was published 
on {{ sources.cpi.metadata.published }}. The next scheduled publication is 
{{ sources.cpi.metadata.next_update }}.
</p>

  This chart shows the monthly, quarterly and yearly percentage changes on the key categories which most affect young
