<h2>About the data on this page </h2>
<p>
These visualisations are driven by consumer price inflation (CPI) data from the 
Office for National Statistics 
<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceinflation"> available here.</a> 
</p>

<p>
The page is automatically regenerated when the latest CPI data is published. The current data was published 
in {{ sources.cpi.stats.CPI_most_recent_month}} {{sources.cpi.stats.date}}.
