<h2>Visualisations</h2>
<p>
These visualisations are driven by consumer price inflation (CPI) data from the 
Office for National Statistics 
<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceinflation"> available here.</a>
We derive percentage change figures from index values, and our values match the monthly and yearly percentage change figures
provided in the dataset, verifying our method. This page is a work in progress with updates added regularly.
</p>
