summary:
  - |
    The Toolkit is a free, online evidence resource. It contains summaries of high-quality evidence on selected interventions aimed at 
    improving youth employment outcomes, with a particular focus on marginalised young people.

  - |
    The first version will contain entries on seven different kinds of intervention and we plan to add more information and update 
    content on an ongoing basis. 

    For each topic, the Toolkit includes findings from a rapid evidence assessment looking at the impact of the intervention on youth 
    employment, along with information about the kinds of activities involved, the sorts of evidence that are available about its 
    effectiveness, and how to implement it well.
