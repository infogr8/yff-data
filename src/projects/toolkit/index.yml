summary: 
- |
  The Toolkit is a free, online evidence resource. It contains summaries of high-quality evidence on selected interventions aimed at 
  improving youth employment outcomes, with a particular focus on marginalised young people. 
  
- |
  The first version will contain entries on seven different kinds of intervention and we plan to add more information and update 
  content on an ongoing basis. 
  
  For each topic, the Toolkit includes findings from a rapid evidence assessment looking at the impact of the intervention on youth 
  employment, along with information about the kinds of activities involved, the sorts of evidence that are available about its 
  effectiveness, and how to implement it well.
